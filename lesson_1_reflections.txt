Viewing the diff helped me quickly find the bug by showing
me only what had changed between the two files. I quickly
found the typo after reviewing the differences.

Having access to the entire history of a file makes it easier
and faster to spot errors that result from changes to the code.

The advantage of manually choosing when to commit is that each
version will be functional and saved at a logical point. The
disadvantage is that, if you're careless, you could forget to
save your code often enough.

Git assumes you'll be working with inter-related files. Other
programs like Google Docs, assume each file is independent.

'git log' and 'git diff' are useful commands for viewing past
changes to the files in a repository.

Version control gives you confidence to experiment. If you break
something, you can always revert back to a working version.

I want to use Git to experiment with my web apps.
