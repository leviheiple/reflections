When you initialize a repository it creates a new
repository in git where you can upload your changes.

The staging area does not commit any files to your repository.
Instead, it keeps them in a staging area until you're ready to
"commit."

The staging area allows me to review changes before commiting
them. I can make sure that I group the commits together logically.

Branches are helpful for when you want to make an alternative
version of your program without changing the original.

Diagrams help you visually understand which the lineage of
each master commit and where you have unreachable commits.

When you merge two branches together the changes and the commit
history are merged into one branch.

Having to manually choose which changes to merge can be annoying.
But it prevents you from creating a merged branch with the wrong
changes when there is a conflict.
